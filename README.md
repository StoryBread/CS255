This was coursework for CS 255 from SNHU

-Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Driver's Pass was a project designed to support people trying to get their Driver's license. It connects a driving instructor with a student and allows a student to practice online before hand.
-What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job isolating the things the client wwanted.
-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Probably some of the design diagrams. I used Lucid chart for everything, but I would have preferred to either draw it by hand or use photoshop.
-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I listened to the conversation they had, and implemented their needs into my design. It's important to design around the user because they are the person who's problem you're solving.
I design software by listening to the user's needs and attempting to solve their problems, not my problems. In the future I'll most definitely use a gantt chart to chart out my time table.
